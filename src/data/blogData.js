        excerpt: "The CBIC has issued new guidelines for reversal of Input Tax Credit in cases of non-payment to suppliers within 180 days.",
        content: `
      <p>The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) has recently issued Notification No. 53/2025, bringing significant changes to the Input Tax Credit (ITC) reversal mechanism. This amendment specifically targets cases where recipients fail to pay suppliers within the stipulated 180-day period.</p>
      
      <h3>Key Highlights of the Notification</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mandatory Reversal:</strong> Taxpayers must now automatically reverse ITC along with interest if payment to the supplier is delayed beyond 180 days from the invoice date.</li>
        <li><strong>Interest Calculation:</strong> Interest will be calculated at 18% p.a. from the date of availing credit until the date of reversal.</li>
        <li><strong>Re-availment:</strong> The credit can be re-availed once the payment is made to the supplier; however, the interest paid cannot be claimed back.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Impact on Businesses</h3>
      <p>This move is designed to curb the practice of artificial credit creation and ensure timely payments to MSMEs. Businesses must now strengthen their accounts payable processes to track aging of invoices rigorously.</p>

      <h3>Recommended Action Plan</h3>
      <p>We advise all our clients to review their creditors' aging report immediately. Identify any invoices pending for more than 150 days and prioritize their clearance to avoid unnecessary interest liability.</p>

        title: "Deadline Extended for Revised ITR Filing (AY 2025-26)",
        excerpt: "CBDT has provided a one-time relaxation for filing revised returns for the previous assessment year. Check your eligibility now.",
        content: `
      <p>In a relief to taxpayers, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has announced a one-time extension for filing Revised Income Tax Returns for the Assessment Year 2025-26. The new deadline is set for <strong>January 31, 2026</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Who Can Benefit?</h3>
      <p>This extension is applicable to taxpayers who:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Missed reporting certain income (like interest or dividends) in their original return.</li>
        <li>Made errors in claiming deductions under Chapter VI-A.</li>
        <li>Noticed discrepancies in their AIS/TIS data after filing.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why File a Revised Return?</h3>
      <p>Filing a revised return allows you to correct genuine mistakes without facing scrutiny notices for "defective returns" or under-reporting of income. It is the last opportunity to clean up your tax record for the year.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> This does not apply to taxpayers who have not filed their original return at all. It is strictly for <em>revision</em>.</p>
